# Continuous Integration with DX in Mind

<!-- 
While I was preparing for this talk, I challenged myself to find any popular library on GitHub that does not use CI.

I couldn't find any. Every repo I looked at had Continuous Integration set up. Apparently CI is an integral part of development.

But why? What makes them so essential? And how to implement them right?

- These are the questions that I wish to answer today.

++++++

Before that though, I would like to know more about you guys.

Raise you hand:
- if you are using Continuous Integration at work?
- and who feels comfortable writing CI workflows?
